# Shell completion scripts

Podman offers shell completion scripts for bash, zsh and fish. The completion scripts are available for both `podman` and `podman-remote`.

The shell completion scripts are generated by `make completions`; do not edit these files directly. To install them you can run `sudo make install.completions`.

For information about these scripts see [`man podman-completion`](../docs/source/markdown/podman-completion.1.md)
